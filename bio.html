<!-- 		<p>	
			Alessio received the MSc degree in Telecommunication Engineering from the University of Trento, Trento, Italy, in 2015. He is currently a research assistant and a Ph.D. candidate with the Centre of Intelligent Sensing at Queen Mary University of London, UK, supervised by Prof. Andrea Cavallaro. From 2017 to 2018, he was a visiting student at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK), Trento, Italy, supervised by Dr. Oswald Lanz. As research assistant, Alessio investigates vision and machine learning algorithms for performing human-to-robot handover under the 
			<a href="http://corsmal.eecs.qmul.ac.uk">CORSMAL</a> project. His research interests include computer vision applied to human-to-robot handover, local image and spatio-temporal features, multi-view reconstruction, and audio-visual object tracking. Alessio is also an IEEE Member and member of the IEEE Signal Processing Society.

		<h3 style="text-align: left;">Research assistant and postdoc at QMUL</h3>
		<p>
		</p> -->
		<h3 style="text-align: left;">PhD at QMUL/FBK</h3>
		<p>
			His Ph.D. was funded from 2015 to 2019 under the Audio-Visual Intelligent Sensing Project, a joint collaboration between QMUL and Fondazione Bruno Kessler 
			(FBK), Italy. Alessio investigated the problem of matching local spatio-temporal features between moving monocular cameras under the supervision of 
			Prof. Andrea Cavallaro (QMUL) and Dr. Oswald Lanz (FBK). 
			He also collaborated within the project to investigate the problem of audio-visual tracking in 3D of a talking person from a co-located camera with a 
			circular microphone array, and the annotation and calibration of the audio-visual recording system for a novel dataset 
			(<a href="https://ict.fbk.eu/units/speechtek/cav3d/">CAV3D</a>) in conjuction with the tracking task. 
			During the Ph.D. program, Alessio was also Demonstrator for the module Introduction to Computer Vision with Prof. Andrea Cavallaro for the years 2018 and 2019.
			He prepared tutorials, assisted students during the lab sessions, and marked/graded the module coursework (software and report).
		</p>
		<h3 style="text-align: left;">Internship at INRIA Grenoble Rhone-Alpes</h3>
		<p>
			For the master thesis, Alessio took a 6-months internship with the <a href="https://team.inria.fr/perception/">PERCEPTION</a> team at INRIA Grenoble Rhone-Alpes (March-August 2014), and 
			he investigated the problem of Multiple Object Tracking under the supervision of Dr. Radu Horaud (INRIA) and Dr. Nicola Conci (MMLAB, UNITN), and co-advised 
			by Xavier-Alameda Pineda and Sileye Ba.
		</p>
		<h3 style="text-align: left;">Bachelor and Master at UNITN/INRIA</h3>
		<p>
			Alessio obtained the Bachelor degree in Electronic and Telecommunications Engineering (2008-2012) and the Master degree (2-years) in 
			Telecommunications Engineering (2012-2015) at University of Trento (UNITN), Italy. 
			From March to September 2015, before starting the Ph.D., Alessio also collaborated with <a href="https://mmlab.science.unitn.it">MMLAB</a> (UNITN) for the development of a client-server application within the LifeGate project and for the collection and annotation of datasets for the <a href="http://www.multimediaeval.org/mediaeval2015/eventsync2015/">Synchronization of Multi-User Event Media</a> task.
