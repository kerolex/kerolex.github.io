                <!-- Introduction -->
                <h2>The Challenge Ahead</h2>
                <p>
                    Perception and robotics have imopressively progressed in recent years, yet one of the most fundamental 
                    tasks — grasping and manipulating objects — remains challenging in real-world settings. 
                    The <b style="font-weight: bold;">11th Robotic Grasping and Manipulation Competition (RGMC)</b> brings 
                    together researchers, engineers, and innovators to tackle this problem head-on.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Held during the <b style="font-weight: bold;">2026 IEEE/RAS International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</b> in Vienna, 
                    RGMC provides a unique event to benchmark your work against other state-of-the-art solutions and 
                    advance robotic grasping and manipulation in practical, unconstrained environments.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <b style="font-weight: bold;">🎯 Why Participate?</b><br>
                    <p>
                        RGMC isn't just a competition — it's a community-driven initiative to solve real problems 
                        in robotic grasping and manipulation. Whether you're an academic lab, industry team, or student group, 
                        you'll gain access to cutting-edge hardware, publish peer-reviewed research, and 
                        compete for recognition and cash prizes.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Overview -->
                <h2>What is RGMC?</h2>
                <p>
                    The Robotic Grasping and Manipulation Competition is an annual event that 
                    represents a unique approach to advancing the field and challenges teams 
                    to develop robust solutions for grasping and manipulating objects in real-world conditions 
                    rather than relying on simulation or isolated lab benchmarks. 
                    Now in its <b style="font-weight: bold;">11th edition</b>, RGMC has been running since 2016 at either ICRA or IROS, 
                    engaging the community with diverse tasks for manufacturing, service robotics, and logistics. 
                    Previous editions have featured challenges including assembling and disassembling boards, 
                    hand-in-hand grasping, picking and placing various objects, pouring liquids, bin picking, 
                    table arrangement, and cloth folding. Each task is designed to expose the gap between controlled environments and practical 
                    deployment. Variable illumination, occlusions, object variability, and 
                    unpredictable physical interactions are not obstacles to overcome; 
                    they are the core of the challenge.

                    The impact of RGMC extends far beyond competition results, growning into a thriving community of researchers 
                    and practitioners advancing robotic grasping and manipulation
                    The research community has embraced the competition as a reference point for rigorous benchmarking: 
                    recent findings have been published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/MRA.2024.3481609" target="_blank">
                    <em>IEEE Robotics &amp; Automation Magazine</em></a>, 
                    dedicated IROS workshops have established best practices for competition design and evaluation, 
                    and an active <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8F4S4EjTAo2JbwdzbyKnCA" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, 
                    featuring 23+ demo videos from competing teams, is maintained to 
                    provide valuable documentation of diverse solution strategies. With ten completed editions across ICRA and IROS, 
                    RGMC is a relevant venue for validating robotic solutions in practical, reproducible settings.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The 2026 edition features four specialized tracks covering different aspects of robotic manipulation:
                </p>

                <h2>The Human-to-Robot Handover Track</h2>
                <p>
                    This year, we're spotlighting the <b style="font-weight: bold;">Human-to-Robot Handover track</b>—now in its <b style="font-weight: bold;">3rd edition</b> — 
                    which addresses one of the most critical challenges in collaborative robotics: 
                    enabling safe, reliable transfer of objects from human hands to robotic grippers. 
                    Building on the success of previous editions at 
                    <a href="https://corsmal.github.io/rgm24icra/index.html" target="_blank">ICRA 2024</a> and 
                    <a href="https://corsmal.github.io/rgmc2025-handover-track/" target="_blank">ICRA 2025</a>, 
                    this track continues to push the boundaries of real-world human-robot collaboration.</p>

                <div class="track-card">
                    <h3>🫱🥤🤖 Real-Time Physical Property Estimation</h3>
                    <p>
                        The core challenge: <b style="font-weight: bold;">
                            Can your robot safely and smoohtly receive - in real-time - a set of 
                            unknown containers with unknown filling handed over by a person and 
                            deliver them to a target location without dropping them?
                        </b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Teams must design solutions that enable robots to infer the physical properties 
                        (mass, stiffness, fill level) of objects during dynamic handovers, 
                        using only affordable perception. This is harder than it sounds. 
                        Consider the real-world complexities:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b style="font-weight: bold;">Unknown objects:</b> Food containers and drinking glasses of varying shapes and sizes</li>
                        <li><b style="font-weight: bold;">Unknown content:</b> Containers may be empty or filled with unknown substances at unknown levels</li>
                        <li><b style="font-weight: bold;">Unknown physics:</b> The robot must estimate physical properties on-the-fly, with no prior knowledge</li>
                        <li><b style="font-weight: bold;">Perceptual challenges:</b> Illumination variations, reflections, transparencies, and occlusions from both the human and robot</li>
                        <li><b style="font-weight: bold;">Hardware constraints:</b> No motion capture systems or markers— only affordable sensors (cameras, microphones and tactile sensors)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                <p>
                    Human-to-Robot Object Handover is fundamental to collaborative robotics. 
                    From manufacturing to assistive robotics to household automation, 
                    robots that can safely receive objects from humans open entirely new possibilities. 
                    However, the task demands simultaneous excellence in perception, control, safety, and generalization. 
                    By solving handover, we're pushing robotics closer to real-world deployment in diverse environments.

                <!-- Community & Impact -->
                <!-- <h2>Growing Impact: From 2016 to 2026</h2>
                <p>
                    Since 2016, RGMC has grown into a thriving community of researchers 
                    and practitioners advancing robotic grasping and manipulation. In the last few years, the competition has published 
                    findings in <em>IEEE Robotics &amp; Automation Magazine</em>, organized three dedicated 
                    workshops at IROS, and maintains an active <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8F4S4EjTAo2JbwdzbyKnCA" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> 
                    featuring 23+ demo videos from competing teams. With ten completed editions across ICRA and IROS, 
                    RGMC has established itself as the premier venue for validating robotic solutions 
                    in practical, reproducible settings.
                </p> -->

                <h2>A Challenging but Essential Task</h2>
                <p>
                    The Human-to-Robot Handover track tackles one of robotics' hardest problems: 
                    reliable real-world performance while collaborating with a person. 
                    This is why participation has been modest—only teams with mature solutions 
                    and significant resources can realistically compete.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The track's first year (ICRA 2024) revealed the gap between lab conditions and conference reality. 
                    Nine teams registered worldwide; three competed on-site. Teams faced immediate challenges: 
                    unfamiliar hardware with minimal setup time, real-world lighting variations, 
                    and the need for rapid system calibration. 
                    Most teams struggled to complete even a fraction of the 24 handover configurations. 
                    The best performance achieved just 18/100, a reminder that real-world manipulation 
                    is fundamentally different from lab controlled conditions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The trajectory from 2024 to 2025 tells us a story of progress. 
                    The ICRA 2024 winning team returned in Atlanta and not only won again, 
                    but dramatically improved their score to 70/100. 
                    This represents a 4x improvement and demonstrates that the benchmark successfully drives innovation. 
                    Yet the score also shows substantial room for advancement, 
                    making the track ideal for researchers ready to push the boundaries of what's possible.
                    It's an excellent benchmark for the next generation of solutions.
                    <!-- The challenges of the track shows the gap 
                    between current capabilities and what real-world handover demands. -->
                </p>

                <p>
                    For ICRA 2026, we're seeing growing momentum. 
                    Eleven teams have already applied to the handover track, with more expected before the deadline. 
                    We anticipate a maximum of 6 teams will qualify for on-site participation, 
                    your chance to test your solution against the other teams and the real-world conditions of the competition.
                    Whether you're developing new perception algorithms, adaptive control strategies, 
                    or innovative sensor fusion approaches, the handover track will push your work to 
                    its limits and provide the validation only live competition can offer.
